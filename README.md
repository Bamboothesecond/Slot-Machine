*I made this game last 2020 as my Final Project for academic purposes, so most likely I forgot the installation process, I redownloaded this file through the assignment tab. Feel free to explore!

*A slot machine Java project is a program designed to simulate the experience of playing a slot machine. The project typically involves creating a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays the slot machine's reels, along with buttons to spin the reels and collect winnings.

*The project will involve using Java's built-in libraries and frameworks to create the GUI and handle user interactions. Additionally, the program will need to generate random numbers to determine the outcome of each spin, and calculate the player's winnings based on the combination of symbols that appear on the reels.
